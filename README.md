-----------------
# Goal of this project
- is to experience the actual progress of game development that will be sold to the customers

# What is done for the project?
- Create a game design with details - Control system? Resources? What is the strength of this game compared to the other similar games? Why would people play this game?
- Following what I learned from Eco-op, have made BMC(business model canvas) and set value proposition and detailed target customers
- Seek for target customers from several sites, and introduce the game design and current progress of the development to the potential future customers
- Keep their attention by uploading weekly development progress report every week
- Upload beta version of games for getting feedback from the potential customers, and modify current game design if needed based on useful feedbacks.
- While doing so, study by myself for required skills to develop the game as my game design

# What is Nyctophobia?
- It is a game based on Vampire Survivors system, with original features and horror. The player needs to survive for 10 minutes(5 min for beta versions) against the monsters and ghost monsters.

# About features
**Mental Point**<\br>
This is the current mental condition of the player character. When it gets hit by monsters, it loses Mental Point value. It can be recovered by turning on the candle for a long time.

**Candle**<\br>
The player can turn it on and off, and turned on candle lights up area near the player and cures the player's Mental Point slowly. If the candle is turned off, then player will get continuous Mental Point Damage.

**Mental Broken Level**<\br>
This is the current Mental Broken status of the player character. Once Mental Point reaches below 0, Mental Broken Level increases, and Mental Poitn value goes back to 100. Increased Mental Broken Level cannot be recovered.

**Boss Ghost Monster**<\br>
They comes out periodically. There are currently 3 types of Boss Ghost Monsters, and the player need to get some strategy to get rid of them - just having high damage is not enough to defeat them. When a Boss Ghost Monster appears, no normal monsters will be spawned and player cannot turn on the candle until the player defeats the Boss Ghost Monster.

**Ghost Monster**<\br>
They appear on map once player's Mental Broken Level increases to 2. There are multiple Ghost Monster Types, and they cannot be defeated. Player must run away from it or endure the collision. On collision, it gives short screen effect and high Mental Point Damage.

# Goal of this project
- is to experience the actual progress of game development that will be sold to the customers

# What is done for the project?
- Create a game design with details - Control system? Resources? What is the strength of this game compared to the other similar games? Why would people play this game?
- Following what I learned from Eco-op, have made BMC(business model canvas) and set value proposition and detailed target customers
- Seek for target customers from several sites, and introduce the game design and current progress of the development to the potential future customers
- Keep their attention by uploading weekly development progress report every week
- Upload beta version of games for getting feedback from the potential customers, and modify current game design if needed based on useful feedbacks.
- While doing so, study by myself for required skills to develop the game as my game design
